								<p>
									Below are some projects that I worked on that showcases my skills in Excel, Tableau, SQL, and Python. More to come!

											<a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AuThqpvLArYAiU7EmiWfbm5iRoxE" class="image fit" target="_blank">Coffee Sales (Excel)<img src="images/CoffeeData.png" alt="Excel Coffee Data Project"></a>
											<p>
												In this Excel project, I developed a comprehensive data analysis portfolio centered around coffee sales. The focal point of the portfolio is a dynamic dashboard that incorporates various visual elements such as charts, a timeline, and slicers. 
												When selecting the filters, the charts will interact and change to reflect the sales.
												</p>

											<a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AuThqpvLArYAiW-Uh62ab2Zu6aWv" class="image fit" target="_blank">Movie Data (Excel)<img src="images/Movie-Data.png" alt="Excel Movie Data Project"></a>
											<p>In this second Excel project, I analyzed data with movies from the years 1980 - 2020. We take a look to see how inflation has changed throughout the years, and also topics such as which genres tend to be the most profitable.
												With multiple labeled worksheets and charts for visualization, the data is clear and understandable. </p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
											<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12RuPUCav1kmdVq_q80jik6PXpY-gaUOSUVIdGXe5orQ/edit?usp=sharing" class="image fit" target="_blank">Museums & Paintings (SQL)<img src="images/SQL-Paintings-Data.png" alt="SQL Paint Data Project"></a>
											<p>This project involved analyzing a database containing information on artists, paintings, styles, museums, and subjects.
												 Through SQL queries, we investigated various aspects such as the distribution of artists' works across different countries, the prevalence of cubist paintings in museums, and the most frequently painted subjects for different painting styles. 
												 The analysis provided insights into trends within the art world, including the popularity of certain artistic movements and subjects across different regions and time periods.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
											<a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19Data_17075082209900/GlobalVaccineTracker?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" class="image fit" target="_blank">COVID-19 Vaccinations (Tableau)<img src="images/COVID-19_Data_Tableau.png" alt="COVID-19 Data Using Tableau"></a>
											<p>Using Tableau, I created a bar chart, map, and a scatter plot to visually represent how different countries around the world compared to others when it came to COVID-19 vaccinations, breaking down the percentage of people who are partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, or not at all. 
												By using the filters at the top of the dashboard, users can change the date range, continent, and even the country. 
												All visualizations will change accordingly. The data ranges from September 4th, 2020 to October 25th, 2021.</p>
